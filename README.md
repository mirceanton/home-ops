This is a monorepo that holds the configuration for my home Infrastructure and Kubernetes Clusters.

## Quickstart

In order to clone and start using this repo, you need to have Taskfile installed, then use the `tools` task to install all the other dependencies:

```bash
wget https://github.com/go-task/task/releases/download/v3.28.0/task_linux_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i task_linux_amd64.deb
task tools
```
