### My home operations repository :octocat:

_... managed with Flux, Renovate and GitHub Actions_ :robot:

</div>

---

## 📖 Overview

This is a monorepo for my homelab infrastructure automation. I try to adhere (as much as I reasonably can 😅) to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using the tools like `Ansible`, `Terraform`, `Kubernetes`, `Flux`, `Renovate` and `GitHub Actions`.

### Directories

```sh
📁 .taskfiles           # Holds all of the "modules" for my Taskfile automation
📁 clusters             # Holds one sub-directory per cluster in my homelab
├─📁 _common            # Commonly used workloads, deployed across all of the clusters
├─📁 management         # Management Cluster Flux Repo
└─📁 home               # Home Cluster Flux Repo
📁 docs                 # MkDocs Documentation Source
📁 infra                # Infrastructure Automation, structured per-element
├─📁 home-cluster       # Talos Configuration for the home cluster
├─📁 management-cluster # Talos Configuration for the management cluster
```

## 🤝 Gratitude and Thanks

There is a template over at [onedr0p/flux-cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template).

Thanks to all the people who donate their time to the [Kubernetes @Home](https://discord.gg/k8s-at-home) Discord community. A lot of inspiration for my cluster comes from the people that have shared their clusters using the [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/topics/k8s-at-home) GitHub topic. Be sure to check out the [Kubernetes @Home search](https://nanne.dev/k8s-at-home-search/) for ideas on how to deploy applications or get ideas on what you can deploy.
